## The purpose of this program
This software can be used by companies to evaluate the psychological state of an employee. The program administers a test to the user called SCL-90 in order to determine whether the employee is suffering from a psychological issue or not. It should only be used when there is an employee that suddenly starts working less and you(the supervisor) want to find out why.

## How the program works
When the program starts running, the user will be asked to share some personal data such as name, social security number, home address and then the evaluation will begin. The user will have take the test(Scl-90) and answer to 90 questions. After the test, the program will calculate the score obtained on each scale(9 in total) and it will print to the console the results for the user to see. After that, the program will create a notepad file where it will store the results of the test for the supervisor to see.

## What happens after examination
If the user obtained a high score on one or more scales of the test( higher than 1.5) the program will conclude that the user is suffering from a real mental health issue. If that is the case, the program will ask the user if he/she wants to ask for the help of a mental health professional. If the user chooses this option, he/she will have to write a message in the console(for the mental health professional) that will be stored to another notepad file and then the program will stop executing.

If the user obtained normal scores on all scales(smaller than 1.5), the user does not need psychological help and the program will stop executing after the test is finished. However it's worth mentioning that in both cases(whether the user is suffering from a real mental health issue or not), the results of the test will be available for a supervisor to see inside another notepad file.

## Benefits of using this program(DOFA)
This program can be used to save time and money. Instead of sending each employee that does not perform as well as before to Human Resources, the supervisors can instead use this software to find out if the drop in performance of each employee can be explained by psychological causes or not.
