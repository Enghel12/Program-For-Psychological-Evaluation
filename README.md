/*This program does the following, 1.take user input from an user(an employee of a company)
	2.Ask him/her questions regarding name, age, social sec number, address, email..
	3.Prompts the user to take a psychological test called SCL-90 (it is a valid test) and
	asks for the consent of the user when he/she shares his/her data
	4.By using the test, it determines based on the user's score if he/she is suffering from
	a psychological problem or if they are actually alright
	5.If the user is suffering from something real, he/she can go ask for help and then a
	notepad file will be created which will be send to a specialist so that the employee can
	get the necessarry help
	6.Inform the supervisor about outcome of the test. If it is determined by the test that the
	current employee lied, then the program let's the supervisor decide if he/she wants to
	go and talk with that employee and discuss the problem or if he/she wants another supervisor
	to deal with the issue.

	/*A few important notes: 
	* a)The idea behind this project is this: If suddenly the performance of an employee of
	* a company suffers a drop, then instead of trying to find out about what the issue could
	* be by sending that employee to Human Resources and then to a therapist, the employee can
	* use the DOFA program to go through a psychological test which will reflect what the issue
	* could be and save a lot of time and money. However it is important to note that this program
	* cannot replace a therapist, and cannot come up with a diagnose. All that it does is to
	* determine if the employee might be suffering from a condition and if that is the case,
	* the employee has the option to ask for help and go to a specialist
	* 
	* b)The user is asked for consent about sharing his/her data 
	* but the supervisor can only see what is the outcome of the test, not the private information
	* of that employee
	* 
	* Also if the employee does not suffer from any real condition, the supervisor does not
	* have the right to directly fire that employee, he/she can just discuss the problem with
	* the employee and try to find out why he/she is not working as well as before
