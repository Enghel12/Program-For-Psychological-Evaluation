/*Imagine you have an employee at a company that suddenly starts working less, you can clearly see a significant drop in
the work performance of that employee. You, as a supervisor start to think about sending that employee to Human Resources 
to take care of the issue but you don't want any money to be spent on this issue. Here comes the Dofa Program. The purpose of this program is to administer the employee a psychological test called SCL-90 in order to determine whether the user 
is suffering from a psychological issue which would explain the drop of work performance, or to determine if the user does simply not want to perform as well as before due to another reason. 

After the administration of the test, the program calculates the outcome of the test and it will determine whether the user is suffering from a psychological issue or not. Then the user is informed about the test results and the program stops executing. Throughout the runtime of the program, a few notepad files will be created. One will contain the test results that will be available for a supervisor to see, to learn what to do with the employee, for instance to help the employee find a therapist if the program reached the conclusion that the employee is suffering from a serios mental health condition.

Also if the program determines that the user needs help, the user can then write a letter to ask for the help of a therapist, and the content of the letter will be saved to a notepad file which can be sent later via mail. There is much more that the program does but the description would be too long. 

All in all this program was created with the purpose of saving money that would have been used by Human Resources. Instead of sending that employee directly to talk to Human Resources(where money would have been spent), the employee can easily take the test(which costs 0 dollars) and in the event that the employee actually suffers from a psychlogical issue, then a therapist will be searched for and the employee will receive the help needed.

	/*A few important notes: 
	
	* 1.The user is asked for consent before sharing his/her data 
	* but the supervisor can only see what is the outcome of the test, not the private information
	* of that employee(the program must be ethical)
	* 
	* 2.Also if the employee does not suffer from any psychological condition, the supervisor does not
	* have the right to directly fire that employee, he/she can just discuss the problem with
	* the employee and try to find out why he/she is not working as well as before
